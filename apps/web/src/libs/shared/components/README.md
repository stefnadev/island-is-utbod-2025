# Shared Components

This library contains Island.is components that can be shared between multiple projects and interfaces.

Unlike island-ui components, these components may depend on the island.is technical architecture, like our translation system, feature flags, authentication, GraphQL API and more.

## Running unit tests

Run `nx test shared-components` to execute the unit tests via [Jest](https://jestjs.io).
